# Lecture source files

This folder contains the source files for the lecture slide .pdfs.

To open these, you'll mainly need [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) Impress (.odp) and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) (.svg).

## License

**All original material** is released under the **CC BY-SA 4.0** license, same as the main repository.

If you create a modified version of the lectures, *please remove the TUT logo on the first slide of each slide set, and instead use the one for your affiliation*.

### Material not original to these lectures

The drawing of a *python natalensis* (1840) by Sir Andrew Smith, used in lecture 1, is in the public domain.

### Logos

Any logos used in the slides are **not** covered by the license.

The lecture slides use the TUT logo, because this is the original version of the course that was lectured at TUT (spring term 2018).

Any other logos are used solely for identification purposes, and do not imply endorsement or affiliation.

Unless otherwise mentioned, logos are used under the *right of citation* (part of Finnish copyright law). GitHub being US-based, in that jurisdiction the use of these logos falls under *fair use*.

In alphabetical order:

 - [Anaconda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaconda_(Python_distribution)#/media/File:Anaconda_Logo.png)
 - [Cython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cython#/media/File:Cython-logo.svg)
 - [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/static/img/haskell-logo.svg)
 - [IPython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPython#/media/File:IPython_Logo.png) - CC BY-SA-3.0
 - [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/assets/main-logo.svg)
 - MATLAB. The "MATLAB logo" used in the slides is **not** the actual MATLAB logo, which is trademarked by Mathworks Inc., but instead [this file by Wikipedia user Jarekt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB#/media/File:Matlab_Logo.png) that just resembles the MATLAB logo, and is in the public domain.
 - [Lisp](http://www.lisperati.com/logo.html) - public domain. Lisp, being a family of languages, has no single official logo. This is more a case of technical humor in the form of fan art, but the author proposes to use it as one would use a logo.
 - [Matplotlib](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Created_with_Matplotlib-logo.svg)
 - [NumPy](https://github.com/valohai/ml-logos/blob/master/numpy-logo.svg), based on the original from the [NumPy repository](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/7e7f4adab814b223f7f917369a72757cd28b10cb/branding/icons/numpylogo.svg).
 - [Python](https://www.python.org/community/logos/) - use explicitly permitted *to indicate suitability for use with Python or implementation in Python*.
 - [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/img/racket-logo.svg)
 - SciPy. Searching the internet for images of "python scipy" finds this one; it is clearly the background of the buttons at the [SciPy homepage](https://scipy.org/), but the bare logo has not been released. If you use Google, searching for different sizes then allows to pick the largest one.
 - [Spyder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyder_(software)#/media/File:Spyder_logo.svg) - MIT license
 - [SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/master/doc/src/logo/sympy.svg) - BSD license (3-clause)
