# python-3-scicomp-intro

Informal introduction to Python 3 **for scientific computing**.

## What and for whom

If you MATLAB and/or Fortran, but don't yet Python, and you work or study e.g. in the engineering sciences with no formal background in computer science or IT, this guide is for you.

This is *not* a general guide to Python for general-purpose programming. Neither is it completely self-contained. Links to online material are provided, and the reader is expected to follow them where applicable.

The course is split into two parts. The first part an introduction to Python from a scientific computing viewpoint, hopefully with enough information (and external links) to explain how to get basic things done in Python and in NumPy.

The second part consists of a selection of advanced topics. For example, we cover some of the very basics of software engineering, such as taking advantage of version control (specifically `git`) and linters (automated static code analysis and code style analysis).

We concentrate on Python 3 only, as it is the current version, and legacy support (Python 2) [will end by 2020](http://www.python3statement.org/).

## Status

The [lecture notes](python_scicomp_notes.pdf) are complete, but code examples as separate `.py` files and a better README are to be added later.
